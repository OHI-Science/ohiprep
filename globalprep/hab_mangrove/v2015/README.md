### Mangrove data: trend and extent

Data used to calculate mangrove extent and trend are based on a slightly modified version of the ["MFW, Mangrove Forest Cover Loss since 2000 in areas with year 2000 Mangrove Forest"](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~sehamilton/mangroves/index.html) dataset from:

Hamilton, S. E., & Casey, D. (2016). Creation of a high spatio-temporal resolution global database of continuous mangrove forest cover for the 21st century (CGMFC-21). Global Ecology and Biogeography, 25(6), 729-738. doi:10.1111/geb.1244.

Because the 30m resolution raster the data is provided as (although awesome!) can be difficult to work with, we created a 500m resolution raster and converted to a Mollweide coordinate reference system.

Health is based on 2012 data (v2012) because the time frame of thee data is not long enough for a good health estimate.
