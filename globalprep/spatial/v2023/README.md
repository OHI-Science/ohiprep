This folder contains an updated version of v2017's rgn_uninhabited_islands.csv file within the output folder. No other files were updated in v2023 so this is the only file included here, contained within the same folder structure as used in v2017. 

Column names were kept the same for consistency but three new columns were add: source (contains a link to the data source(s) the information was found at), data_year (year that the information is accurate as of, to the best of our knowledge), and notes (explanations on why we chose the values we did).
