## Ocean Health Index: Seagrass data for the habitat subgoal, coastal protection goal, and carbon storage goal

This folder includes the extent, health, and trend data for seagrass. These data have not been updated since the 2012 assessment because no suitable updates are available. We explored new data sources (hab_seagrass/v2016_explore) but were not able to improve the data.

More information about the goals is available:
* [habitat subgoal/biodiversity goal](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#biodiversity)
* [coastal protection](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#coastal-protection)
* [carbon storage](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#carbon-storage)

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
