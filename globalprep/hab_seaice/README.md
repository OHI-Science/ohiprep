## Ocean Health Index: Seaice data for the habitat subgoal and coastal protection goal

This folder includes the extent, health, and trend data for seaice (shoreline and edge). 

More information about the goals is available:
* [habitat subgoal/biodiversity goal](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#biodiversity)
* [coastal protection](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#coastal-protection)

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Our [data managment SOP](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/master/src/dataOrganization_SOP.html) describes how we manage OHI global data, including a description of the file structure.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
